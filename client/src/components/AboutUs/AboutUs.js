      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Hello i am Axense and i am a web developer/web designer.My programming
        journey started about in February 2021 with Python(since is so easy).I
        made some projects in Python like a Login System and a Blackjack Game
        and had fun making them soo i wanted to continue to program to be able
        to make more fun projects.The thing that gets me going is getting stuck
        on a project then thinking about a solution.I love to do that.Anyways
        after playing around with Python for a bit i then wanted to get in the
        field of programming so i just chose a branch(web/game/software
        development) and ofcourse i chose web development(it looked like the
        best one for me).After that,i started learning the basics of HTML,CSS
        and then JS(by watching a tutorial then just making projects using the
        information that i have gathered by watching the tutorial).After making
        some projects using the basics,i wanted to learn a frontend framework so
        i chose React since it was the most popular one,and i wanted to make
        some sweet cash aswell down the road.It was actually pretty easy to
        learn it(learned it from Coding Addict’s Youtube Channel) and then i
        just did a shit ton of projects using React(since by doing that i
        practice React and the basics of web development aswel).I have also
        learned Github,Netlify,Heroku,Node.js,
        Express.js,MongoDB,Mongoose,Cloudinary,Redux and some other smaller
        stuff.I won’t go in depth since i do not want to spend 10 years writing
        this about us sooo i am just going to end this here.
